This is a little implementation of Vigenere cipher in Scala. It was written purely to show my capabilities of learning something at the speed light of light.

There's nothing fancy, it doesn't take arguments from the command line, there isn't any error handling, nothing. Just `git clone` this repository, and run it. That's it

Output should like this:

```
Enter your message: INTELLIAS
Enter your key: SCALA
Encrypted message: APTPLDKAD
Decrypted message: QLTTLTGAH
```

```
Enter your message: APTPLDKAD
Enter your key: SCALA
Encrypted message: SRTALVMAO
Decrypted message: INTELLIAS
```
